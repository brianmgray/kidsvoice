Expungement is a legal process by which your juvenile record is erased and no one can see it. Your juvenile delinquency record is __not confidential or sealed__. Your record __does not__ automatically go away when you turn 18. Federal and state laws prohibit employment of ex-offenders with criminal convictions in certain jobs. Fortunately there are many cases where your juvenile records can be expunged.


# What kind of records __CAN__ be expunged?

Records of juvenile delinquency cases and records from the magistrate involving summary offenses committed while you were under 18 years old can be expunged, upon the courtâ€™s motion or motion of a child, the parent or guardian, after 30 days notice to the district attorney, and if one of the following apply: 

1. a petition or complaint is filed which is withdrawn or dismissed by the court; or

2. six months have elapsed since the expiration of a consent decree or diversion program and no further action is pending (talk to your probation officer about expunging your consent decree); or 

3. five years have elapsed since the final discharge from commitment or probation and no other adjudications or proceedings are pending; or 

4. you are 18 years of age or older and it has been six months since you satisfied/completed all terms and conditions of your sentence from a summary offense conviction before a magistrate (except a violation of Section 6308) and you have not been convicted of a felony, misdemeanor or adjudicated delinquent and there are no proceedings pending; or 

5. you are 18 years of age or older and six months have elapsed since you have satisfied/completed all terms and conditions of your sentence from a conviction for a violation of Section 6308 (relating to purchase, consumption, possession or transportation of liquor or malt or brewed beverages), including any suspension of operating privileges; or 

6. five years have elapsed since your probation case closed and since then you have not been convicted of a felony, misdemeanor or adjudicated delinquent and there are no proceedings pending; or 

7. the attorney for the Commonwealth agrees and a court orders expungement after consideration of the following:
	
	a. type of offense
